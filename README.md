# DACS - Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Course

Welcome to the official code repository for the Data Structures and Algorithms course offered by the Department of Advanced Computing Sciences at Maastricht University. This repository houses the code examples presented during the lectures, organized by week and topic.

## Course Structure

The repository is organized into modules corresponding to each week of the course:

- `module_1`: Code examples from Week 1 lectures
- `module_2`: Week 2 lectures and lecture notes code
- `module_3`: Code examples from Week 3 lectures
- `module_4`: Week 4 lectures and lecture notes code
- `module_5`: Code examples from Week 5 lectures
- `module_6`: Week 6 lectures and lecture notes code

## Using This Repository

Students are encouraged to explore the code examples alongside the lectures to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts discussed. The code for even weeks includes examples from the lecture notes, providing further insights into the applications of data structures and algorithms.
